Stuff I want to add: 
- A menu at the end of each lvl to show stats 
- Moving platforms
- Revamp of 1-3 (making #1 just a tutorial lvl) 




The rest of the changelogs are not with me atm will update once I find it 

V 0.01.02.1
- fixed bug where the prediction point for the grappling hook, would show on the player's screen and would stay on a static place on the screen while grappling (stays in a position on the map)
- Added more clouds to level 4

V0.01.02.2_1
- fixed issue where tabbing out of the game would create a grapple point in the world that could not be destroyed
- updated lvl 3 with better meshes (still want to change it a bit more)
- Started pause menu logic - will finish by 1.02.3
