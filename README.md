Using Editor Version 2022.2.18f1

Minimum specs:

12GB of RAM

10GB of Storage 

Recommended specs (what I use):

12th Gen 17-12700

TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME:
extract the .zip 
Run Beta.exe

Stuff I want to add: 
- A menu at the end of each lvl to show stats
- Settings for DPI changes, volume mixer when I add SFX, key binds (I won't do graphics setting) (40% done)
- Moving platforms
- Revamp of 1-3 (making #1 just a tutorial lvl)

- Controller support (this will be later)

- I still need to bind WASD to its respective directions so I can put it in the keybinds settings, I also need to add pause keybinds to that + mouse dpi and inverted. 
- I also need logic to save them to the player's computer so they don't need to set it again and again.



The rest of the changelogs are not with me atm will update once I find it 

V 0.01.02.1
- fixed bug where the prediction point for the grappling hook, would show on the player's screen and would stay on a static place on the screen while grappling (stays in a position on the map)
- Added more clouds to level 4

V0.01.02.2_1
- fixed issue where tabbing out of the game would create a grapple point in the world that could not be destroyed
- updated lvl 3 with better meshes (still want to change it a bit more)
- pause menu finshed

V0.01.02.2_2
- Started Pause Menu Logic
- Cleaned code up a bit more
